# About Me

<img src="https://tianchenli.com/dog.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Tianchen Li (李天琛)**.

I am now a PhD candidate at Singapore University of Technology and Design, and trying to develop **novel energy storage systems**. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hui Ying Yang](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~yanghuiying) and about to join [Prof. Yayuan Liu's group](https://www.yayuanliu.com) soon as a postdoc at Johns Hopkins University. Here is [my Resume](https://tianchenli.com/file/CV-TCLi.pdf).

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on **interfacial design of zinc metal anode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries**. To tackles the problems of zinc metal anode and prolong the cycle life of full cells for practical application, we have disclosed many strategies including surface modificaiton and electrolyte additive design. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful research project and make our world more sustainable.
